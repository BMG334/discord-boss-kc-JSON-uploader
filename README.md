# Discord Boss KC JSON Uploader
A lightweight plugin that uploads a player's boss kc and pb to a Discord channel via a webhook. Upload only happens when you logout, to avoid spamming. What you do with that data is up to you.

JSON example:

{
"Username": {
"Corporeal Beast": {"count": 0,"pb": 0.0},
//every other boss
}}

Made for a clanmate.

Webhook code based off of https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/discord-loot-logger.
