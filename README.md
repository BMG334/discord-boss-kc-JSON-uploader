# Discord Boss KC JSON Uploader
A lightweight plugin that uploads a player's boss kc and pb to a Discord channel via a webhook. Upload only happens when you log out, to avoid spamming. What you do with that data is up to you.

JSON example:

{"Corporeal Beast": {"count": 0,"pb": 0.0},"TzTok-Jad": {"count": 1,"pb": 5110.0},//every other boss}

Made for a clanmate.

Webhook code based off of https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/discord-loot-logger.
